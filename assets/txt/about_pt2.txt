When I'm not coding, I'm probably out running. I started running actively towards the end of summer 2023 and have grown to love it. Besides running, I also enjoy mountain biking, hiking, and simply spending time in nature.

On days when I'm not outdoors, I like to unwind with video games and movies. And last but definitely not least â€” I appreciate a good cup of coffee!
